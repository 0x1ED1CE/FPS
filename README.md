FPS is a lite 3D physics engine intended to be used for game development. It is NOT physically accurate and makes heavy approximations.

This engine uses clipping for both collision detection and collision response. It does not rely on GJK/EPA or SAT.

## TODO:
- Make it more stable. It's still unusable in its current state.
- Rewrite it in C99. Originally written in Lua to be used with [LÃ–VE](https://github.com/love2d/love)
- Add support for primitive convex shapes (sphere, cylinder, etc)
- Constraints?
